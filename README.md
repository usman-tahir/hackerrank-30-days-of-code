Code snippets from the 30 days of code challenge on Hackerrank

### Day 0 (“Warm up”)
Basic input/output with Java - reading in a string, and appending it to another string before printing the entire string out. This solution simply involved getting the string that was input, and concatenating it to the existing string, along with a newline for formatting purposes.

### Day 1 ("Types")
Basic input output - this time involving integer and double input. This was accomplished by parsing the input as an integer/double, while passing it in as a string (using Scanner#nexLine). The printout was simple, and asked for basic arithmetic (addition), as well as string concatenation.
